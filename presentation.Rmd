# Source
At first, our group found a database on the Internet in which we could find various data about the distance of asteroids relative to the Earth and other data
In the database we can select data that we think are relevant to our report and also compare different asteroids to the same kind of data. This will make the differences more visible.

# Method

- Aim：To discuss is there any difference for us to rank asteroids from closest to furthest by using two properties(semi-major axis & orbital period).

- Premise：Both of these two properties are positively associated to the distance of that asteroid from Earth.
--


- Method 1: ( semi-major axis relative to Earth )

(1) Order its data from smallest to largest -- "arrange()"
< use "abs" inside：use absolute values because we're not talking about ”direction“，just "distance" >

(2) Taking the first 100 observations -- "slice(1:100)"
< we pick a part of the data as example >

--

- like this:
asteriods_semimajoraxis <- asteroid %>%

  arrange(abs(a)) %>%
  
  slice(1:100) #see top 100 to confirm that data displays in ascending order
  
---


- Methods 2: (orbital period )

(1) Order its data from smallest to largest -- "arrange()"

(2) Taking the first 100 observations -- "slice(1:100)"



< Data visualization: after making data frames, we can use ggplot to data more visual>

--
- Conclusion:

Compare two data sets -- "comparedf(dataset1,dataset2)"

If the results are the same, then there is no difference between the two methods; 

If the results are different, we need to find the difference, or if there is a third variable that affects the result.

# Layouts

You can use plain text

- or bullet points

.pull-left[
or text in two columns $^*$
]
.pull-right[
- like
- this
]

.footnote[
[*] And add footnotes
]

# Code

```{r boring-analysis}
# a boring analysis
ave <- mean(cars$dist)
print(ave)
```

---

# Plots

```{r recode-species, echo = FALSE}
# In this chunk I'm doing a bunch of analysis that I don't want to present 
# in my slides. But I need the resulting data frame for a plot I want to present.
iris_modified <- iris %>%
  mutate(Species = fct_other(Species, keep = "setosa"))
```

```{r plot-iris, echo = FALSE}
# Code hidden with echo = FALSE
# Uses modified iris dataset from previous chunk
# Play around with height and width until you're happy with the look
ggplot(data = iris_modified, mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length, color = Species)) +
  geom_point() + 
  theme_minimal() # theme options: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html
```

#Conclusion

- At the end of this project, we would conclude on how many property-based rankings 
agree when analysing asteroid data.
- Furthermore, astronomers use the semi-major axis variable (asteroid-sun distance),a, as the
most reliable property when computing distances between solar system bodies. Hence, 
using the asteroid dataset, we can construct a 3D-map to show the distribution of 
our ranked asteroids based on their distances to the sun.

# Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r iris-table, echo = FALSE}
kable(head(iris), format = "html")
```

---

# Images

```{r castle, echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Image credit: Photo by Jörg Angeli on Unsplash."}
include_graphics("https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1535448033526-c0e85c9e6968?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1650&q=80")
```

Or you can also include a full page image. See next slide.

# Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. &#36;\alpha+\beta$ renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1. The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

1. There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

1. Math does not work on the title slide (see [#61](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/61) for a workaround).

# Feeling adventurous?

- Want to find out more about `xaringan`? See https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#1.

- You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

- But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. The 
`xaringanthemer` provides some solutions for this that: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanthemer.

- And if you want more bells and whistles, there is also `xaringanExtra`: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra.
