## Introduction

In this time data science project, the issue we are discussing is the distance between asteroids and the Earth. We want to do the calculation in two different ways. The first main variable is use the Semi major axis, and for the second main variable is the orbital period. These are the two main variables we choose. So we do some research of the data of it.
One of our team members study the physics, and he find there is a website which might give us the data we want to have. The website is created by the NASA company which a really famous company at the Aviation sector.
Just like the pictures shown in the presentation, in the website it has fore parts. We need to choose different categories in these four parts which can make us get the more accurate data as we want. For the first part which is limit by object kind, we need to choose the comet which is according to our questions. After that we need to choose the asteroid orbit classes. And choose the asteroid we want to get.
For the fourth part which is most important ,we need to help the different asteroid to choose the variables we want to get. in the beginning, we choose thirteen different variables. They are neo,diameter e ,a ,q, I ,om ,w, pery ,moid,sigamw, first obs and last obs.
These different variables have different meaning . for the neo it is near earth object flag. That is the object which the orbit of it is really near to the earth. And for the distance between object orbit and earth orbit need smaller than 1.3 astronomical units. And for the neo if it has similar size with earth which will make dangerous with earth is pho. E is the eccentricity . which is the orbital eccentricity of the subject. If we take the orbit of the Earth as our example. The data shows on e mean the Deviation of the asteroid's orbit from that of the Earth. For the a is the semi major axis . As we know the orbit is usually a oval . There is a line which cross the center and touch two sides of the oval. The q is perihelion distance, that is the closest possible distance between earth and asteroid. I is the inclination. om is the longitude of the ascending node, the Angular pitch between the asteroid at the Ascending node and the asteroid at the point when the ecliptic plane and equatorial plane meet. W is the argument of perihelion which is the argument in the orbit from the ascending node to perihelion. Pery is the time period per years we think year is a suitable time unit. Moid is the smallest distance between two orbits it is different with q which is the smallest distance between two objects.
 

## Method
For exploring whether the semi-long axis and orbital period have the same effect on the ordering of asteroid distances, we have two ways to approach the problem.

 

In method one, we use a ggplot plot to make the data more visual, allowing us to look at it more intuitively. We create two plots based on different variables in the table: Making a histogram with the x-axis as `a` (semi-long axis) and the y-axis as the number of asteroids that occupy a certain semi-long interval. Similarly, we make another histogram with the x-axis as `per_y` (orbital period) and the y-axis as the number of asteroids occupied in each orbital period interval. 

 

We do this because if the semi-long axis and the orbital period have the same effect on the asteroid ordering, their visualizations show a similar trend (since each intervals corresponding to the two visualizations will have almost the same number of asteroids); if the effects are different, it means that the two variables do not have the same effect on the asteroid ordering.

 

In method two, we will explore whether there is a linear relationship between the variable a and the variable `per_y`. So, we will create a linear model between `a` and `per_y` (set_engine("lm")), and in this model, `a` is the response variable, `per_y` is the explanatory variable. Then we apply the `tidy` function for this model, in which we find the R-squared value. 

 

The reason we create a linear model is that if there is a linear relationship between the variable `a` and the variable `per_y`, then we can know that there is a linear relationship between `a` and `per_y`, so if `a` has any effect on the other variables then `per_y` has the same effect on them.




## Discussion of Results & Conclusion
### Discussion of Results

The histograms above show the distribution of the asteroids using the semi-major axis and orbital periods. These histograms also contain information on the closeness (classification by distance) of these asteroids to us since the orbital parameters used are distance-dependent.
As seen on the plots, both classifications show an identical pattern across the entire asteroid data set. This can be explained mathematically by the equation below whereby:

The equation shows a direct linear relationship between the semi-major axis and the orbital period thereby explaining the identical pattern in the histograms above. 

The histogram consists of spacings between the histogram bins of the asteroid positions. These spacings physically represent the Kirkwood gaps in our solar system. As the name implies, Kirkwood gaps refer to the gaps or dips in the distribution of the semi-major axes (or equivalently of the orbital periods) of the orbits of asteroids. Due to the relatively small mass of the asteroids when compared to the planets in our solar system, the asteroids tend to be affected by the resonances (gravitational effects) of Jupiter and the other icy giants namely (in descending order of proximity to the earth): Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. The gravitational resonances of the listed planets clears a region around themselves which cannot be occupied by asteroids. As a result, the first dip on the plotted histograms (from the left) coincides with the region between Mars and Jupiter . This first gap is commonly referred to as the asteroid belt. The next 4 dips represent the regions cleared by the gravitational effects of the icy giants in descending order from the sun as earlier mentioned.

As shown on both histograms, the earliest asteroids can be found around 2AU (2 Astronomical units) whereby 1AU denotes the distance between the earth and the sun. Hence, the closest asteroids to us in the solar system can be found at a distance which is at least twice the sun-earth distance. 
Models
We can model the relationship between the semi-major axes and orbital periods across our classification data set. The values of these parameters are numeric thereby permitting the use of a linear regression model. As described in the methods section, the `tidymodels` package was used to compute the regression model. 

The model output was then visualized as shown below:

The goodness of fit of our model (denoted as R-squared in the method) gave us a value of 0.9979. Since the R-squared value is very close to 1, it confirms the direct correlation between orbital semi-major axis and period as equivalent parameters for classifying asteroids. Interestingly, when two other distant-dependent orbital parameters, orbital inclination and ellipse-- , are added as predictors to the model, the value of R-squared moves slightly closer to 1. Hence, additional parameters can play a role in helping us get a slightly accurate classification of the asteroids. However, these additional parameters by themselves cannot be primarily used as the only predictors since they give very small contributions to the overall R-squared value.

### Conclusion
To conclude, semi-major axis and orbital periods give the same classification of asteroids in our data set.
